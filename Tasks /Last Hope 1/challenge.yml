**INTELLIGENCE REPORT 1/6
Silent Chain, a rogue paramilitary network, is escalating its operations across the Middle East and Europe. 
CIRU (Cyber Intelligence Response Unit) has been tasked with dismantling their chain of command before they execute a series of coordinated strikes.
Last week, during a raid on a Silent Chain safehouse in northern Syria, CIRU recovered a seized data drive containing weeks of raw intelligence—patrol reports,
intercepted radio chatter, and logistics updates. Buried in the chaos is a critical codeword, a failsafe left behind by a careless operative. 
Intelligence suggests this codeword is the key to accessing Silent Chain’s fallback systems and may expose high-value targets and their next strike plans.
your mission is clear: comb through the logs, identify the codeword
