Langley’s notes dwell on the hand behind the tapestry — the vision that brought the Lady and the Unicorn to life. 
He traced stylistic echoes, compared techniques, and searched for a signature that never seemed to appear. 
Perhaps someone’s name lies buried in history… or perhaps the artist’s identity was never meant to be known. 
Can u identify the artist behind the piece?
