At the library, a book is reserved under Langley’s name talking about the Musée de Cluny collection. 
Inside, a section has been highlighted:
“This wall-hanging was acquired in 1882. It is now considered one of the great masterpieces of Western art.”
Langley and Marcel clearly discussed this collection in depth. 
Something about this particular piece seems to have captured his attention.
Find the name of the artwork.
